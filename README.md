# TIDY: Trash Image Dataset 'Yucky'
A dataset in progress containing images of trash, which spans the following classes:

- cardborad
- cigarette butt
- glass
- metal
- paper 
- plastic
- plastic bag
- plastic bottle
- unknown

For each class of trash there are four environments in which the photographs were taken: 

- beach
- sea 
- forest
- street

TIDY is still in progress: ideally, I would continue taking, classifying and uploading photos of trash every day. If you notice a misclassified picture, feel free to correct it.

TIDY's ultimate goal is to provide open data to make trash classification easier. That way we can work on automated recycling systems etc.
